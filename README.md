# FreeCodeCamp's Data visualization projects
This repo contains the projects I made as part of the FreeCodeCamp's data visualization course.

The objective is to consolidate the learnings of the D3.js library and data visualization in general.

I live streamed the whole participation in the course and the projects creation in my [Twitch account](https://www.twitch.tv/grsoares). The recorded sessions are available on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0uQGewjvqzr7gC1Rr1w4nJ2Cqd9w2r8j).

## A note about code quality
These projects were created in the context of a live streaming with the sole purpose of learning and practicing the D3.js API in order to create data visualizations. The priority was immediate visual result and not architecture, tests or any other code quality factors. This SHOULD NOT be considered as evidence for the quality of the code I write nor my skills as a software engineer. I'll be happy to provide examples of the code I write that I consider to be high-quality, if needed.

## Running the projects
Currently the projects are each consisted of 3 files (html, css, and js), simply opening the html file with a browser should be enough to view it. Possibly in the feature I'll create a small single-page-application to be able to browse through them.
